Installing
==========

``pyocf`` is available as a Python package on the Python Package Index.
The best way to install it is to use ``pip``::

    $ pip install pyocf

or::

    $ python3 -m pip install pyocf

This will also install all requirements. If you want to run tests, or contribute you
should install the development requirements, but for normal usage that is not necessary::

    $ pip install pyocf[build]

or::

    $ python3 -m pip install pyocf[build]
