"""Enumeration representing a vesting \"day of month\". Since not all months have
29, 30, or 31 days, this enum requires those values to also specify an overflow
behavior.
 - `01` - `28` : Day 1, 2... 28 of the month; e.g. `03` means vesting occurs on
the 3rd of the month.
 - `29_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH` - `31_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH` : Day 29, 30, or 31 of
the month, defaulting to the last day of the month for shorter months; e.g.
`31_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH` means monthly vesting occurs on Jan 31, Feb 28/29, Mar
31, Apr 30, etc.
 - `VESTING_START_DAY_OR_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH` vests on the same day of month as
the day of the `VESTING_START` condition; e.g. if vesting commences on Jan 15
then any vesting will accrue on the 15th of future vesting months. If vesting
commencement occurs on days 29-31, this has the same behavior as the other
`*_LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH` values."""
